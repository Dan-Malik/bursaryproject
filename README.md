# MongoDB
You will need to install the MongoDB server from the site: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community

You can then run the server.js script 

    node server.js

Currently it will create the database and connect to it to add in one document. The console will show you if your connected and what document has been added in. 

If you have MongoDB Compass Community Installed you should see the database, collection and document.
